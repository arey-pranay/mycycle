             I am an athlete, and getting my periods irregularly completely ruins my morale and interrupts with my practice. I really wished there was some accurate way to know my date of menses and ovulation, and this was the time when I heard about MyCycle from one of the co-founders and I was amazed as well as relieved. It's a completely new technology and approach to cervical mucous analysis. Both- the team and the idea seems promising, and I'm really waiting for the final product to come into market.

I see great potential in it, and with the sensors and technology being used in this product, I feel it is going to come into market real quick and at an affordable price range. Really looking forward to the official launch.
